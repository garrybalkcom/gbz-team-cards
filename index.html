            <h3>Megan Thee Stallion</h3>

            <p>Look at how I bodied that, ate it up and gave it back (ugh)
                Yeah, you look good, but they still wanna know where Megan at (where Megan at?)
                Saucy like a barbecue but you won't get your baby back
                See me in that dress and he feel like he almost tasted that (ah, ah, ah)
                Num, num, num, num, eat it up, foreplay, okay, three, two, one
                You know I'm the hottest, you ain't ever gotta heat me up
                I'm present when I'm absent, speakin' when I'm not there
                All them bitches scary cats, I call 'em Carole Baskins, ah</p>

            <h3>DaBaby</h3>

            <p>It's safe to say I earned it
                Ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
                I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
                Know you heard me say, "You play, you lay"
                Don't make me push the button
                Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
                Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
                I got a big drum, it hold a 100, ain't goin' for nothin'
                I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin</p>

            <h3>Lil Baby</h3>

            <p>Fill the bando up with bags, give the lil' bro them a job
                You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
                Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
                Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
                Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
                All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
                Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
                Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
                I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
                I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
                I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong</p>
